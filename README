Various package.yml to build ROCm on Solus.

Mostly copied from gentoo's ebuilds of the same names, and also from the work of https://github.com/saitam757/Solus-ROCm

Check the package.yml of llvm-roc for -j 1, since you probably to up that number a bit if you have enough memory. Howewer, on my laptop with 8GB + 8GB of swap I cannot go higher.

Attached is also a diagram of the build deps of the various components(stolen from gentoo's ebuilds, so some of them are change in these package.yml), for you to build in the right order.
